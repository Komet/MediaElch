    Falco Biography by Jason Ankeny 
ï¿¼ Falco was the most internationally successful
     pop artist ever to come out of Austria, best known for his 1986 chart-topping h
    it "Rock Me Amadeus." Born Johann Holzel in Vienna on February 19, 1957, he was 
    a classically trained child prodigy, but after graduating from the Vienna Conser
    vatoire, he relocated to West Berlin and began fronting a jazz-rock band. Rechri
    stening himself Falco in honor of the German skier Falko Weissflog, he returned 
    to Vienna in time to play bass on the punk outfit Drahdiwaberl's 1979 album Psyc
    ho Today, penning their best-known song, "Ganz Wein." Falco began his solo caree
    r in 1982 with the LP Einzelhaft; his "Der Kommissar," which fused techno-pop wi
    th rapped German lyrics, became a major European hit and a club favorite in the 
    U.S., with a cover version by the group After the Fire reaching the Top Five in 
    1983. The follow-up, "Jeanny," was banned outright by radio as a result of its t
    heme of prostitution, but nevertheless went on to top the German charts. While 1
    984's Junge Roemer attracted little attention, in 1986 Falco issued Falco 3, hig
    hlighted by the single "Rock Me Amadeus," a campy blend of classical music and s
    ynth pop which topped both the American and British charts. While the rock balla
    d "Vienna Calling" was a minor hit, Falco's subsequent efforts, including 1986's
     Emotional and 1988's Wiener Blut, fared poorly; he had been long out of the spo
    tlight when he died in a car accident on February 6, 1998 at the age of 40.
