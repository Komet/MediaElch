biography:
    Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Los Angeles, California (USA). 

Metallica 
    formed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich. The
     duo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper. At the time
    , Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot 
    on an upcoming compilation record called “Metal Massacre”. Metallica’s contribut
    ion, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist Lloyd Grant.
     Afterwards, Ron McGovney became the band's bassist and Dave Mustaine joined the
     band as lead guitarist. This line-up would re-record "Hit The Lights" for subse
    quent re-pressings of "Metal Massacre" and would also issue several demos. In 19
    83, McGovney quit the group and was replaced by Cliff Burton, which also saw the
     band relocate to San Francisco. Metallica then traveled to New York after signi
    ng a deal with Megaforce Records. However, once in New York, the band fired Must
    aine. It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica,
     mostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press. Mustaine was replace
    d by Kirk Hammett of Exodus (6). 

Metallica's debut LP, "Kill 'Em All", was rel
    eased in 1983. It was followed in 1984 by "Ride The Lightning". This led to a ma
    jor label deal with Elektra. In 1986, the band released "Master Of Puppets", whi
    ch is considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all ti
    me. In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in
     a bus accident which took the life of Cliff Burton. Eventually, Jason Newsted (
    of Flotsam And Jetsam) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut
     on 1987's "Garage Days Re-Revisited", an EP of cover tunes. The full-length "..
    .And Justice For All" followed in 1988, featuring the track "One" which was chos
    en as the subject for their first promotional music video. 

In 1990, Metallica 
    hooked up with producer Bob Rock for a self-titled release that would become bet
    ter known as "The Black Album", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the blac
    k album would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling ov
    er 16 million copies in the US alone. 

In 1996, the band experimented with Rock
     music style Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album "Load". The foll
    owing year, "Reload" appeared which had the similiar formula as ''Load''. The al
    bums continued the band’s trend of more accessible music. In 1999, the group rel
    eased an album and accompanying film called "S&M", which featured Metallica perf
    orming their songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. 

In 2001, as the 
    band was preparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing 
    personal and musical reasons. Work on the new album was further complicated when
     Hetfield entered rehab for alcohol abuse. The album, called "St. Anger", was ev
    entually completed in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass. Upon its re
    lease, "St. Anger" drew mostly negative reviews. Following the recording, Robert
     Trujillo, formerly of Suicidal Tendencies, was hired as bassist. The making of 
    the album was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”. 

In 2008, "De
    ath Magnetic", produced by Rick Rubin, would surface and was hailed by many as M
    etallica's return to thrash metal. The following year, Metallica was inducted in
    to Rock And Roll Hall of Fame. Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Clif
    f Burton's father appeared on Cliff's behalf. Dave Mustaine, who was not inducte
    d, was invited to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend. In 2011, Meta
    llica collaborated with Lou Reed on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned 
    by critics and ignored by consumers.
