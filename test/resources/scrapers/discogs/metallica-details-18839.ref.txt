biography:
    Thrash Metal (Heavy Metal) band from Los Angeles, California (USA). Metallica fo
    rmed in 1981 by vocalist/guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich. The d
    uo first met through an ad in a Los Angeles-based music newspaper. At the time, 
    Ulrich had little musical experience and no band but managed to secure a slot on
     an upcoming compilation record called “Metal Massacre”. Metallica’s contributio
    n, “Hit The Lights”, featured Hetfield, Ulrich and lead guitarist Lloyd Grant. A
    fterwards, Ron McGovney became the band's bassist and Dave Mustaine joined the b
    and as lead guitarist. This line-up would re-record "Hit The Lights" for subsequ
    ent re-pressings of "Metal Massacre" and would also issue several demos. In 1983
    , McGovney quit the group and was replaced by Cliff Burton, which also saw the b
    and relocate to San Francisco. Metallica then traveled to New York after signing
     a deal with Megaforce Records. However, once in New York, the band fired Mustai
    ne. It would mark the beginning of a long feud between Mustaine and Metallica, m
    ostly fueled by remarks Mustaine would make to the press. Mustaine was replaced 
    by Kirk Hammett of Exodus (6). Metallica's debut LP, "Kill 'Em All", was release
    d in 1983. It was followed in 1984 by "Ride The Lightning". This led to a major 
    label deal with Elektra. In 1986, the band released "Master Of Puppets", which i
    s considered by many to be one of the greatest heavy metal records of all time. 
    In September of that year, while on tour in Sweden, the band was involved in a b
    us accident which took the life of Cliff Burton. Eventually, Jason Newsted (of F
    lotsam And Jetsam) was hired as the band's new bassist and he made his debut on 
    1987's "Garage Days Re-Revisited", an EP of cover tunes. The full-length "...And
     Justice For All" followed in 1988, featuring the track "One" which was chosen a
    s the subject for their first promotional music video. In 1990, Metallica hooked
     up with producer Bob Rock for a self-titled release that would become better kn
    own as "The Black Album", due to its cover art. Released in 1991, the black albu
    m would become one of the best-selling rock albums of all time, selling over 16 
    million copies in the US alone. In 1996, the band experimented with Rock music s
    tyle Alternative Rock, this could be heard on the album "Load". The following ye
    ar, "Reload" appeared which had the similiar formula as ''Load''. The albums con
    tinued the band’s trend of more accessible music. In 1999, the group released an
     album and accompanying film called "S&M", which featured Metallica performing t
    heir songs with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. In 2001, as the band was p
    reparing to begin work on a new album, Newsted quit the group, citing personal a
    nd musical reasons. Work on the new album was further complicated when Hetfield 
    entered rehab for alcohol abuse. The album, called "St. Anger", was eventually c
    ompleted in 2003 with producer Bob Rock handling the bass. Upon its release, "St
    . Anger" drew mostly negative reviews. Following the recording, Robert Trujillo,
     formerly of Suicidal Tendencies, was hired as bassist. The making of the album 
    was captured in the documentary “Some Kind Of Monster”. In 2008, "Death Magnetic
    ", produced by Rick Rubin, would surface and was hailed by many as Metallica's r
    eturn to thrash metal. The following year, Metallica was inducted into Rock And 
    Roll Hall of Fame. Former bassist Jason Newsted was present and Cliff Burton's f
    ather appeared on Cliff's behalf. Dave Mustaine, who was not inducted, was invit
    ed to the ceremony by the band but declined to attend. In 2011, Metallica collab
    orated with Lou Reed on the album, “Lulu”, which was largely panned by critics a
    nd ignored by consumers.
