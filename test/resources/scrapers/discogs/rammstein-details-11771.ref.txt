biography:
    Rammstein (German pronunciation: [ˈʁamʃtaɪn]) is a German rock band, formed in 1
    994 in Berlin. Since its formation, Rammstein's six-man lineup has remained unch
    anged - singer Till Lindemann, guitarists Richard Z. Kruspe and Paul H. Landers,
     bassist Oliver "Ollie" Riedel, drummer Christoph "Doom" Schneider and keyboardi
    st Christian "Flake" Lorenz. Rammstein were among the founding bands of a German
    /Austrian subgenre in the mid-1990's where industrial rock and (groove) metal we
    re mixed in a vein that became known as NDH, Neue Deutsche Härte (lit. New Germa
    n Hardness), clearly inspired by industrial acts like Laibach, Die Krupps and Mi
    nistry, but also metal bands like Pantera and Sepultura. The majority of their s
    ongs are in German, but they have also performed songs entirely or partially in 
    other languages, including English, Spanish, French and Russian. Rammstein's awa
    rd-winning live shows are known for their pyrotechnic elements and both on and o
    ff-stage theatrics, and nowadays, they call their music Tanz Metal ("Dance Metal
    "). There has been some controversy around their name. During their formative ye
    ars 1993/94, they were throwing out names while in Feeling B's tour bus, and som
    eone wrote Rammstein Flugschau ("Rammstein Air Show") on the wall. Ramstein Air 
    Base outside Kaiserslautern in southern Germany is mainly the headquarters for t
    he US Air Forces in Europe and Africa. In 1988 there was a horrible accident dur
    ing an Italian air show that killed 70 people. They contemplated other names, li
    ke Milch (Milk), Erde (Earth) and Mutter (Mother), but the misspelt Rammstein st
    uck with them. They have long since distanced themselves from the old name and s
    tory. Members: Till Lindemann – lead vocals, harmonica Richard Z. Kruspe – lead 
    guitar, keyboard, backing vocals Paul Landers – rhythm guitar, backing vocals Ol
    iver Riedel – bass Christian Lorenz – keyboard, samples, synthesizers Christoph 
    Schneider – drums, percussion
