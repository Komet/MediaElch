review:
    Even though Master of Puppets didn't take as gigantic a leap forward as Ride the
     Lightning, it was the band's greatest achievement, hailed as a masterpiece by c
    ritics far outside heavy metal's core audience. It was also a substantial hit, r
    eaching the Top 30 and selling three million copies despite absolutely nonexiste
    nt airplay. Instead of a radical reinvention, Master of Puppets is a refinement 
    of past innovations. In fact, it's possible to compare Ride the Lightning and Ma
    ster of Puppets song for song and note striking similarities between correspondi
    ng track positions on each record (although Lightning's closing instrumental has
     been bumped up to next-to-last in Master's running order). That hint of conserv
    atism is really the only conceivable flaw here. Though it isn't as startling as 
    Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets feels more unified, both thematically and 
    musically. Everything about it feels blown up to epic proportions (indeed, the s
    ongs are much longer on average), and the band feels more in control of its dire
    ction. You'd never know it by the lyrics, though -- in one way or another, nearl
    y every song on Master of Puppets deals with the fear of powerlessness. Sometime
    s they're about hypocritical authority (military and religious leaders), sometim
    es primal, uncontrollable human urges (drugs, insanity, rage), and, in true H.P.
     Lovecraft fashion, sometimes monsters. Yet by bookending the album with two sli
    ces of thrash mayhem ("Battery" and "Damage, Inc."), the band reigns triumphant 
    through sheer force -- of sound, of will, of malice. The arrangements are thick 
    and muscular, and the material varies enough in texture and tempo to hold intere
    st through all its twists and turns. Some critics have called Master of Puppets 
    the best heavy metal album ever recorded; if it isn't, it certainly comes close.
     [In 2017 the band released a massive expanded edition of the album with a varie
    ty of physical package options, the most ambitious of which was an exhaustive bo
    x set that included a hardcover book, outtakes and previously unreleased intervi
    ews, three LPs, ten CDs, a cassette, two DVDs, a lithograph, a folder with handw
    ritten lyrics, and a set of six buttons.]
