overview:
    Ned opens a theme park to the memory of his late wife Maude and it becomes a hug
    e success when people kneeling in front of a statue of Maude experience mystic v
    isions. The reason for this is that a grille in front of the statue is an out-pi
    pe for a propane gas line and they are getting high on the gas. Unfortunately th
    e park is closed down when Homer and Ned try to stop two children from lighting 
    a candle before the altar and are charged with assault.Ned does,however,enjoy th
    e further company of Rachel Jordan,despite his efforts to turn her into a clone 
    of Maude. Written by don @ minifie-1
