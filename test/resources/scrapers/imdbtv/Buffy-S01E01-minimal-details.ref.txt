overview:
    Buffy Summers just moved with her mom from L.A. (where she set fire to the schoo
    l gym) to Sunnydale, which is, alas, experiencing a plague of vampires. She meet
    s nerd Willow Rosenberg, cool skateboarder Xander Harris, and his mate Jesse McN
    ally, fashionable snooty Cordelia Chase and the somewhat creepy British libraria
    n, Rupert Giles. When a corpse with bite-marks is found in a locker, she realize
    s, but refuses to acknowledge, that her vampire-killing past is catching up with
     her and keeps Giles, her watcher (trainer), at arms-length, but is stalked by A
    ngel who refers to the hell-mouth. Finally her destiny kicks in. Written by KGF 
    Vissers
