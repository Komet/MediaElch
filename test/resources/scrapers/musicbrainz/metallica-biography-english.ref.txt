biography:
    Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was formed in 1981 in Los An
    geles by vocalist and guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, and has 
    been based in San Francisco for most of its career. The band's fast tempos, inst
    rumentals and aggressive musicianship made them one of the founding "big four" b
    ands of thrash metal, alongside Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer. Metallica's curren
    t lineup comprises founding members and primary songwriters Hetfield and Ulrich,
     longtime lead guitarist Kirk Hammett and bassist Robert Trujillo. Guitarist Dav
    e Mustaine, who formed Megadeth after being fired from Metallica, and bassists R
    on McGovney, Cliff Burton and Jason Newsted are former members of the band. 
Met
    allica first found commercial success with the release of its third album, Maste
    r of Puppets (1986), which is cited as one of the heaviest metal albums and the 
    band's best work. The band's next album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Met
    allica its first Grammy Award nomination. Its fifth album, Metallica (1991), was
     a turning point for the band that saw them transition from their thrash roots; 
    it appealed to a more mainstream audience, achieving substantial commercial succ
    ess and selling more than 16 million copies in the United States to date, making
     it the best-selling album of the SoundScan era. After experimenting with differ
    ent genres and directions in subsequent releases, Metallica returned to its thra
    sh metal roots with its ninth album, Death Magnetic (2008), which drew similar p
    raise to that of the band's earlier albums. The band's eleventh and most recent 
    album, 72 Seasons, was released in 2023. 
In 2000, Metallica led the case agains
    t the peer-to-peer file sharing service Napster, in which the band and several o
    ther artists filed lawsuits against the service for sharing their copyright-prot
    ected material without consent, eventually reaching a settlement. Metallica was 
    the subject of the acclaimed 2004 documentary film Metallica: Some Kind of Monst
    er, which documented the troubled production of the band's eighth album, St. Ang
    er (2003), and the internal struggles within the band at the time. In 2009, Meta
    llica was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band co-wrote the sc
    reenplay for and starred alongside Dane DeHaan in the 2013 concert film Metallic
    a: Through the Never, in which the band performed live against a fictional thril
    ler storyline. 
Metallica has released eleven studio albums, four live albums (i
    ncluding two performances with the San Francisco Symphony), twelve video albums,
     one cover album, two extended plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos. The band h
    as won ten Grammy Awards from 26 nominations and had six consecutive studio albu
    ms – from Metallica through Hardwired... to Self-Destruct (2016) – debut at numb
    er one on the Billboard 200. Metallica ranks as one of the most commercially suc
    cessful bands of all time, having sold more than 125 million albums worldwide as
     of 2018. Metallica has been listed as one of the greatest artists of all time b
    y magazines such as Rolling Stone, which ranked the band in 61st place on its li
    st of 100 greatest artists of all time. As of 2017, Metallica is the third-best-
    selling music artist since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991, selli
    ng 58 million albums in the United States.
