# Maintainer Documentation

This directory is intended for maintainers of MediaElch.
Why have this information public? Because it should be easy for new
people to maintain MediaElch when the current one can't anymore.

I try to document every step I take to maintain MediaElch, release
a new version, etc. and also what problems I ran into, what websites /
documents / guides I had to read to fully understand the packaging process
because honsetly, the hardest part of releasing MediaElch on launchpad.net,
OBS and everything else was to find resources that explain how that can be
done including best practices and basic tutorials.
