# Synchronization with Kodi

In order to synchronize data between MediaElch and Kodi you need to visit MediaElchs settings first and enter Kodi's IP address, port and your credentials.

Then select movies, tv shows or concerts you wish to update.
Right click on them and choose "Add to synchronization queue".
You'll notice an orange sync icon in front of each of them.
In the main toolbar click on the sync to Kodi icon and choose the appropriate action.
