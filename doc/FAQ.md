### Where are MediaElchs settings stored?
MediaElch stores its settings in the usual places depending on your OS:

 - macOS: `~/Library/Preferences/com.kvibes.MediaElch.plist`
 - Linux: `~/.config/kvibes/MediaElch.conf`
 - Windows: Registry: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/kvibes/MediaElch`

Temporary files, caches and the internal database are also stored in the default storage locations depending on your OS:

 - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/kvibes/MediaElch/`
 - Linux: `~/.local/share/data/kvibes/MediaElch/`
 - Windows: `C:\Users\yourUserName\AppData\Local\kvibes\MediaElch\`

If you are using the portable mode (only available on Windows) then all settings and temporary files are stored in the application directory itself.
