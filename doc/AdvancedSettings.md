# Advanced Settings

You can use a file called `advancedsettings.xml`. This file will not be created automatically, you have to create it on your own. It should be placed in following locations:

 - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/kvibes/MediaElch/advancedsettings.xml`
 - Linux: `~/.local/share/data/kvibes/MediaElch/advancedsettings.xml`
 - Windows: `C:\Users\yourUserName\AppData\Local\kvibes\MediaElch\advancedsettings.xml`

As an alternative the `advancedsettings.xml` can also be placed in the application directory.

For all possible settings, see [`advancedsettings.xml`](advancedsettings.xml).
